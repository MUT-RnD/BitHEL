# BitHEL
This repository hosts BitHEL (Bitstream High-Entropy Layout), a lossless compression scheme designed for high-entropy, small-scale bitstreams.
The repository is associated with a manuscript currently under review. To promote transparency, enable independent verification, and support future research, the complete set of experimental resultsâ€”including source code and associated dataset, will be made publicly available upon publication.
